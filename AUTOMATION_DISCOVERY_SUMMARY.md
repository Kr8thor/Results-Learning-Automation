## Technology Stack

### Primary Systems
1. **Teachworks** - Student/lesson/teacher management
   - Handles: Lesson scheduling, student profiles, teacher availability, completion tracking
   - Core users: Kristen (Special Education), Katie (Program Management)
   - API available: Yes (needs verification)

2. **Google Sheets / Excel** - Secondary data aggregation layer
   - Used by: All staff (5/5)
   - Contains: Manual reports, hour tracking, program metrics, revenue data

### The Integration Gap (Root Cause of "Copying Data")
**Problem**: Teachworks data isn't automatically flowing to spreadsheets
- Kristen manually exports student hours from Teachworks → enters into tracking sheet
- Katie manually pulls lesson/program data → enters into multiple reporting sheets
- Both manually compile weekly/monthly reports from scattered data

**Solution**: API integration workflow to auto-sync Teachworks → Spreadsheets
- Pull lesson data daily/weekly
- Calculate hours, completion rates, revenue
- Auto-populate reporting sheets
- **Estimated time saved**: 4-6 hours/week for Kristen, 2-3 hours/week for Katie

### Secondary Systems
- **Email**: Gmail / Outlook (all staff)
- **Accounting Software** (Nikki - likely for financial tracking)
- **CRM System** (Nikki - not specified)
