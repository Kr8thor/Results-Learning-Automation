# YIELD Framework™ - One-Page Overview
## Automation Investment & Performance-Based Billing Model

---

## The Opportunity
Your team spends **625 minutes/day (10.4 hours/day)** on repetitive manual work.

**That's $62,000/year in salary cost** on tasks that automation can eliminate.

---

## The Solution: YIELD Framework™
**Your Efficiency In Linearly-Delivered Expertise**

### How It Works
1. **We measure** the exact time each process currently takes (baseline)
2. **We build** n8n automation workflows to eliminate manual work
3. **We measure again** to prove actual time saved (monthly)
4. **You pay only** for hours of time actually saved (€3-10/hour depending on complexity)

### Key Benefits
✅ **Zero Risk** - Pay only for actual results (not promises)
✅ **Transparent** - See monthly dashboard of time saved
✅ **Measurable** - Timestamp logs prove the numbers
✅ **Flexible** - Cancel anytime if it's not working
✅ **Scalable** - Start with 4 workflows, add more later
