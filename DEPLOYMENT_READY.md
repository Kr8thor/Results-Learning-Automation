## What's New (Accelerated Plan)

### ⚡ 8-Week Timeline (vs Original 12 Weeks)

**Original**: 3 weeks baseline + 5 weeks build + 4 weeks live
**New**: Infrastructure in 2 days + 4 core workflows by Week 4 + Live by Week 8

### Key Changes
| Phase | Original | Accelerated | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline Measurement | 2 weeks | Integrated as-you-go | 2 weeks |
| Infrastructure Setup | 1 week | 2 days | 5 days |
| Workflow Development | Sequential | Parallel | 1-2 weeks |
| Testing & Launch | 2 weeks | Integrated | 1 week |
| **Total** | **12 weeks** | **8 weeks** | **4 weeks** |

### Cost Impact
- **Same infrastructure cost**: $120-360/year
- **Same YIELD services**: €3-10/hour (pay for actual time saved)
- **Faster payback**: ROI achieved by Week 8 instead of Week 12
- **Earlier YIELD billing**: Starts Week 5 instead of Week 9
