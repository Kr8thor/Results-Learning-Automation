## Agenda (45 minutes)

### 1. OPENING (2 minutes)
**Goal**: Establish credibility and scope

*Say this*:
> "Thank you all for completing the questionnaire. We analyzed responses from all five of you and identified significant opportunity to reduce manual work. I want to show you what we found, what it costs, and how we get paid only when you save time."

**Show**: Brief summary slide (if using slides)
- 625 minutes/day on manual work
- 5 team members, 10.4 hours/day total
- $62,000/year cost to your organization

---

### 2. THE PROBLEM (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Make the pain tangible and quantified

*Walk through the time allocation*:

| Person | Daily Hours | Biggest Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Cyle | 6 hrs | 4 hours/day data entry 🔴 |
| Katie | 13 hrs | Multi-system data syncing |
| Kristen | 6.5 hrs | Copying data (frustration 5/5) |
| Jennifer | 4.75 hrs | Email management & scheduling |
| Nikki | 4.25 hrs | Staff coordination |

*Say this*:
> "Cyle, you're spending 4 hours a day on data entry. That's 20 hours a week. At your level, that's probably not the highest-value use of your time. We can automate that entirely."

> "Kristen, you rated copying data between systems as 5/5 frustration. We can make that automatic. Same with Katie's multi-sheet tracking."

**Show**: Bar chart of time spent (if available)

---

### 3. THE YIELD FRAMEWORK (10 minutes)
**Goal**: Explain the billing model and why it's different

*Start with the concept*:
> "We've developed something called the YIELD Framework™ - Your Efficiency In Linearly-Delivered Expertise. It's a different way to approach automation. Here's how it works:"

**Step 1: Measure the baseline**
> "We'll precisely measure how long each process takes right now. Not estimates - actual timestamps. We'll document every step."

**Step 2: Build the automation**
> "We design n8n workflows - that's an automation platform - to eliminate the manual work. These integrate with your existing systems: Teachworks, Google Sheets, Gmail."

**Step 3: Measure the results**
> "Once it's live, we measure again. We run the automation alongside your manual process for two weeks to prove how much time it actually saves. No guessing, no promises. Real numbers."

**Step 4: You pay for results**
> "Here's the important part: You pay monthly based on **actual time saved**, measured independently. If the automation doesn't save time, you don't pay. If it saves 10 hours, you pay for 10 hours. That's it."

**Show the pricing tiers**:

| Tier | Rate | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | €3/hour | Email routing, form-to-sheet, simple rules |
| Tier 2 | €5/hour | Multi-system sync, data validation, reporting |
| Tier 3 | €8/hour | Complex workflows, API integration, logic |
| Tier 4 | €10/hour | Custom development, special cases |

*Say this*:
> "We only win when you win. Our incentive is directly aligned with your productivity. No software licenses, no subscription fees you don't use, no upfront risk."

**Key differentiator to emphasize**:
- ❌ Traditional automation: $5-10k upfront, hope it works
- ✅ YIELD: Start with infrastructure cost ($10-30/month), pay monthly for results

### 4. INFRASTRUCTURE OPTIONS (10 minutes)
**Goal**: Get decision on Option A vs B

*Introduce the choice*:
> "You have two paths forward. Same automation platform, same time savings, different ownership model."

**Option A: Shared Infrastructure** (LEAD WITH THIS)

*Say this*:
> "Option A: You pay us $10 a month. We manage everything. We host your n8n instance on our server alongside other clients. You never think about infrastructure. You get backups, monitoring, updates, SSL certificates - all included. It's the cleanest option."

**Show**:
- Infrastructure cost: $10/month ($120/year)
- What's included: Full management, backups, monitoring
- Setup time: 24-48 hours
- Switching option later: Yes, anytime

**Financial example**:
> "Here's the math. Let's say we automate 15 hours/week of work. At an average savings rate of €5/hour, that's €75/month in time value you're reclaiming. You pay €10 for infrastructure. So €65 net benefit before even counting your staff's time."

**Option B: Dedicated Server** (ONLY IF THEY ASK)

*Say this*:
> "Option B: You own your own Hetzner server. We can set it up for you, and if you want, we can manage it with ongoing support. But the infrastructure is yours."

**Show**:
- Your infrastructure cost: $4.50/month (paid directly to Hetzner)
- Optional management: $30/month for premium support
- Control: Total ownership, you're responsible for server maintenance
- Setup time: 3-5 days

**When to use Option B**:
- You want total control over your infrastructure
- You have technical staff who can manage servers
- You need a dedicated instance (compliance, security)
- You're planning significant growth (100+ workflows)

**My recommendation**:
> "For Results Learning, Option A makes the most sense. Simpler, faster to deploy, lower cost, no infrastructure headaches. You focus on your programs, we handle the technology. Option B is available if you change your mind later."

### 5. YEAR 1 FINANCIAL IMPACT (8 minutes)
**Goal**: Show the ROI and justify the investment

**Show this table**:

```
INVESTMENT SIDE:
Infrastructure (Option A):             $120
YIELD Services (estimated):          $3,120
───────────────────────────────────────────
Total Year 1 Investment:             $3,240

BENEFIT SIDE:
Time Saved:                     15 hours/week
                          × 50 work weeks = 750 hours/year
                          × €20/hour value = €15,000/year

Net Benefit:                        €11,760
Return on Investment:                  362%
```

*Say this*:
> "You invest $3,240 this year. That time savings is worth $15,000 in staff productivity. That's a 4:1 return. And that's conservative - doesn't even include the strategic value of Cyle having 20 hours/week back for higher-level work."

**Month-by-month**:
> "Month 1 is measurement and setup. Month 2, first automations go live. By Month 3, you're seeing time savings. By Month 6, you've recovered your investment. Months 7-12 are pure benefit."

**Per-person impact** (if they want detail):
- **Cyle**: 15 hrs/week freed (4 hours/day data entry eliminated)
- **Kristen**: 4 hrs/week freed (no more manual data copying)
- **Katie**: 6 hrs/week freed (multi-sheet tracking automatic)
- **Jennifer**: 3 hrs/week freed (email triage automatic)
- **Nikki**: 2 hrs/week freed (templates & reminders automatic)

---

### 6. TIMELINE & NEXT STEPS (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Move to decision and schedule kickoff

**Present the timeline**:

```
Week of Jan 13:  You decide on Option A or B
Week of Jan 20:  Kickoff call + baseline measurement setup
Week of Jan 27:  Precise time measurement complete
Week of Feb 3:   First workflows deployed
Week of Feb 24:  Go live + start YIELD billing
```

*Say this*:
> "We can start baseline measurement the week of January 20. That's three weeks of precise time logging to establish 'before' numbers. Then we build the automations while you continue your normal work. By early March, you'll see actual time savings."

**Get decision**:
> "Before we go any further, I need you to decide: Option A or Option B? Option A is my recommendation - it's simpler and faster. But either way works."

**Schedule the kickoff call**:
> "If Option A: Great. Then we schedule a 30-minute kickoff call to walk through what you'll track during baseline measurement."

> "If Option B: Okay. Different setup process, but same outcome. We'll discuss the management level you want and timeline."

**Confirm API access**:
> "One more thing - we'll need to confirm you have API access enabled for Teachworks, Google Sheets, and Gmail. That's what lets the automations work. Do you have access or does that need to be set up?"

---

### 7. Q&A (5 minutes)
**Likely questions and answers**:

**Q: What if the automation breaks?**
> "We monitor it 24/7. If something fails, we get alerted and fix it. Plus you have visibility into everything - you can see the logs anytime. If it's broken, you don't pay for that hour of savings."

**Q: Can we try it on one person first?**
> "Absolutely. We recommend starting with Kristen's data copying (simplest) or Jennifer's email triage. Prove it works on one person, then expand. Low risk."

**Q: What if we want to change our workflows later?**
> "Easy. The measurement dashboard shows ROI per workflow. If one isn't working, we modify it or turn it off. If a new manual process pops up, we can automate it. It's flexible."

**Q: What systems do you integrate with?**
> "Your existing tools: Teachworks, Google Sheets, Gmail, Supabase for the questionnaire data. We don't replace your systems - we connect them and eliminate the manual copying between them."

**Q: How much of your team's time does this require?**
> "Baseline measurement (Week 2): 3-4 hours total for interviews. Deployment (Week 3-6): 1 hour per person for training. After that: nothing. The automation runs automatically."

**Q: What if Results Learning grows? Does this scale?**
> "Yes. One server can handle 100+ workflows for multiple clients. You're not paying per workflow or per user. You pay per hour of time saved. If you add more workflows, cost goes up only if you save more time."

## Key Phrases to Use

**Confidence builders**:
- "We measure everything - no guessing"
- "You only pay for actual time saved"
- "No risk - cancel anytime"
- "Your systems stay yours - we just connect them"

**Pain-focused**:
- "That 4 hours/day of data entry - we can eliminate it"
- "No more copying between Teachworks and Sheets"
- "Your inbox will handle itself"

**ROI-focused**:
- "362% return on investment"
- "You recoup costs by Month 6"
- "Every month after that is pure benefit"

**Urgency-focused**:
- "Start measurement next week"
- "Live by early March"
- "Cyle gets 20 hours/week back by Q1"

---

## Objection Handling

**"This sounds too good to be true"**
> "I understand. That's why we measure everything independently. We don't charge based on promises - only actual time saved, timestamped and documented. You can audit the numbers anytime."

**"We've tried automation before and it didn't work"**
> "That's actually common - many automation projects fail because they don't have buy-in or proper measurement. YIELD Framework™ is different because (1) we measure the baseline first, (2) we measure results in parallel before going live, (3) you only pay for actual results. If it doesn't work, you don't pay."

**"We're too busy to do the baseline measurement"**
> "That's exactly why we're doing this. The baseline measurement IS the data you need. During those two weeks, you're logging time anyway - we're just asking you to be precise about it. It actually takes less time than usual because you're paying attention."

**"Can't you just automate everything?"**
> "Not everything should be automated. Some decisions are best made by humans. Our goal is to automate the repetitive, manual, low-value work so your team can focus on what only you can do - program development, client relationships, strategy."

## Closing Script

*After you've answered questions*:

> "So here's what we're looking at. You've got 625 minutes a day of manual work. We can cut that significantly in the first 90 days. You pick the infrastructure model - I recommend Option A for simplicity. We spend two weeks measuring exactly what we're starting with, then two weeks building automations, then we go live.

> You pay monthly based on actual time saved. No upfront risk, no surprises, no subscriptions you're not using.

> The question is: Do we start the measurement the week of January 20?

> [If yes] Great. I'll send you the measurement guidelines today. We'll schedule the kickoff for Tuesday or Wednesday of that week.

> [If they need more time] Okay. What specifically would help you make a decision? Is it more detail on one workflow? Different numbers? Different timeline? Let's clarify that now so we can move forward."

---

*Remember*: You're not selling a product. You're offering to give Cyle back 20 hours/week and the rest of your team back 15+ hours total. The numbers and the framework are just the mechanism. Lead with the benefit.

**Good luck!**
