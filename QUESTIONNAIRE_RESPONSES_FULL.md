**Status**: Draft (Incomplete)
**Progress**: 29% Complete
**Response ID**: ffc37756-d0a1-49e8-8db2-48059867749a

### Section 2 and Beyond: INCOMPLETE

**Status**: Cyle abandoned the questionnaire at 29% completion after Section 1.

**Collected Data**:
- CEO spending 240 minutes/day (4 hours) on data entry with frustration level 4/5
- This is the single biggest time sink for the organization
- Email management 60 min/day
- Scheduling 30 min/day
- Chasing info 30 min/day

**⚠️ CRITICAL - Action Required**:
Follow-up interview needed ASAP to understand:
1. What specific data is being entered 4 hours/day?
2. Can someone else do this instead (delegate)?
3. Is this business-critical data or administrative overhead?
4. What systems is data being entered into?
5. Could this be automated entirely?
6. What would Cyle focus on with 4 extra hours/day?

**Impact**: Automating Cyle's data entry would free up 20 hours/week - largest single opportunity
