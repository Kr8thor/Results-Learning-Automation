## Executive Summary

We've completed a comprehensive discovery process with your team and identified **24+ hours per week** in manual, repetitive work that can be eliminated through strategic automation. This proposal outlines:

1. **YIELD Framework™** - A performance-based automation billing model where you only pay for actual time saved
2. **Infrastructure Options** - Two clear paths to implement n8n automation
3. **Financial Impact** - Detailed ROI showing 900%+ return on investment
4. **12-Month Roadmap** - Phase-by-phase implementation plan

**Bottom line**: Invest $120-360/year in infrastructure + success-based fees on actual time saved = $6,000+ annual value at zero upfront risk.

## The Problem: Current State Analysis

### Time Allocation Across Your Team

Our questionnaire revealed **625 minutes/day (10.4 hours/day)** spent on repetitive, manual work:

| Team Member | Role | Daily Hours | Key Pain Point |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cyle Feingold** | CEO | 6.0 hrs | 4 hrs/day data entry 🔴 |
| **Katie Tun Zan** | Program Mgmt | 13.0 hrs | Multi-system data sync |
| **Kristen** | Special Ed Director | 6.5 hrs | Copying data 5/5 frustration |
| **Jennifer Preston** | Business Manager | 4.75 hrs | Email triage & scheduling |
| **Nikki Milton** | HR | 4.25 hrs | Staff coordination |

**Combined**: 34.5 hours/week on manual processes = **1,794 hours/year**

### Annual Cost to Your Organization

At average staff salary of $50,000/year ($24/hour):

```
625 min/day × 250 work days = 155,000 minutes/year
155,000 min ÷ 60 = 2,583 hours/year
2,583 hours × $24/hour = $62,000/year in lost productivity
```

**This is money you're already paying for - being spent on tasks that shouldn't require human time.**

### Biggest Frustration Points

1. **Cyle's 4-hour/day data entry** (240 min) → Highest single opportunity
2. **Kristen's data copying** (frustration 5/5) → Moving between Teachworks + Sheets
3. **Katie's multi-system tracking** (13 hours/day) → Program, financial, compliance sheets
4. **Jennifer's email management** (120 min) → CEO routing and research
5. **Nikki's staff chasing** (30 min) → Getting timely responses

## The Solution: YIELD Framework™

### What is YIELD?

**YIELD Framework™** (Your Efficiency In Linearly-Delivered Expertise) is a performance-based automation model where:

- ✅ **You pay only for actual time saved** (measured monthly)
- ✅ **No risk** - If automation doesn't save time, you don't pay
- ✅ **Transparent** - See exact hours saved per workflow
- ✅ **Scalable** - Add more automations as you grow
- ✅ **Measurable** - Monthly dashboard shows ROI

### How It Works

1. **Baseline Measurement** (Week 1-2)
   - We precisely measure how long each process currently takes
   - Document exact steps, systems used, frequency
   - Establish "before" state with hard numbers

2. **Automation Design & Deployment** (Week 3-6)
   - Build n8n workflows for priority automations
   - Test thoroughly before going live
   - Train your team on new processes

3. **Live Measurement & Billing** (Week 7+)
   - Run automation alongside manual process for 2 weeks
   - Measure actual time saved (not theoretical)
   - Bill monthly based on real results
   - Monthly dashboard showing time saved, cost, ROI

### Billing Tiers

We bill per **hour of time actually saved** at tiered rates based on process complexity:

| Tier | Hourly Rate | Typical Processes |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** | €3/hour | Simple routing, form-to-sheet, email rules |
| **Tier 2** | €5/hour | Multi-system sync, data validation, reporting |
| **Tier 3** | €8/hour | Complex workflows, API integration, conditional logic |
| **Tier 4** | €10/hour | Custom development, special cases |

**Example**: If Kristen's weekly reporting saves 4 hours/week @ Tier 2 = €20/week = €80/month = €960/year

**Key feature**: You can disable any automation anytime. If we're not saving time, we don't charge.

## Infrastructure Options

You have two clear paths forward. Both use the same automation platform (n8n) but differ in ownership and management.

### Option A: Shared Infrastructure (RECOMMENDED) ✅

**You pay us a fixed monthly fee. We handle all infrastructure.**

```
Monthly Cost to Results Learning: $10/month ($120/year)
```

**What's included**:
- n8n automation platform (fully managed)
- Server hosting & monitoring (24/7)
- Automatic backups & disaster recovery
- SSL/HTTPS security
- Software updates & patches
- Unlimited workflows (n8n can handle 100+)

**How it works**:
- We maintain a server at Hetzner ($4.50/month)
- You're one of up to 10 clients on that server
- Each client gets isolated n8n instance
- We bill you monthly, you pay us

**Your advantage**:
- ✅ Simplest setup (24-48 hours)
- ✅ No infrastructure management
- ✅ Lowest infrastructure cost ($120/year)
- ✅ Focus on YIELD savings, not servers
- ✅ Can migrate to Option B anytime

**Our advantage**:
- We own infrastructure, can manage 10+ clients at this price
- Scales efficiently as we grow

**Invoice looks like**:
```
YIELD Services (measured monthly):           $300-500
Infrastructure & Hosting:                     $10
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly:                                $310-510
```

---

### Option B: Dedicated Server (Premium Control)

**You own your server. We manage setup and optional support.**

```
Monthly Infrastructure Cost to Results Learning: $4.50/month (Hetzner direct)
```

**What you own**:
- Dedicated Hetzner server (your account, your server)
- You're responsible for paying Hetzner directly
- You maintain complete control

**Our role** (choose one):

#### B1: Setup Only ($0-200 one-time)
- We set up n8n and PostgreSQL on your server
- We train your team
- You manage the server yourself (only call us for emergency support)

**Your cost**: $4.50/month (Hetzner) + $0 (optional support)
**Best for**: Tech-savvy teams, maximum autonomy

#### B2: Managed Support ($200 setup + $15/month)
- Everything in B1, plus:
- Weekly monitoring & health checks
- Monthly updates & security patches
- Email support (48-hour response)

**Your cost**: $4.50/month (Hetzner) + $15/month = ~$234/year
**Best for**: Peace of mind, ongoing support

#### B3: Premium Managed Service ($500 setup + $30/month)
- Everything in B2, plus:
- Weekly proactive monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Daily backups verified
- Priority support (24-hour response)
- Quarterly business reviews

**Your cost**: $4.50/month (Hetzner) + $30/month = ~$414/year
**Best for**: Enterprise-grade reliability, dedicated attention

### Option A: Shared Infrastructure ($10/month)

```
Infrastructure Cost:                         $120/year
YIELD Services (estimated):                 $6,000/year*
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Investment:                           $6,120/year

Time Saved (measured):                      24+ hours/week
Value of Time Saved:                        $576/week = $30,000/year†
─────────────────────────────────────────
NET BENEFIT:                                $24,000/year
ROI:                                        390%
```

*Estimate based on questionnaire discovery; actual YIELD services determined by measurement
†At average $24/hour salary rate

### Option B: Dedicated Server with Premium Management ($30/month)

```
Infrastructure Cost:                         $354/year (Hetzner direct)
Managed Services (Premium):                  $360/year
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Investment:                           $714/year

Time Saved (measured):                      24+ hours/week
Value of Time Saved:                        $576/week = $30,000/year†
─────────────────────────────────────────
NET BENEFIT:                                $29,286/year
ROI:                                        4,100%
```

†At average $24/hour salary rate

**Key insight**: Option B has higher ROI because our management fee ($30/month) is lower than the infrastructure we'd normally charge ($120/month). Trade-off: You own the infrastructure, which requires more on your side.

## Investment Comparison

### Year 1 Costs (Including YIELD Services & Infrastructure)

| Option | Infrastructure | YIELD Services | Total Year 1 | Monthly |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A: Shared** | $120 | $6,000* | $6,120 | $510 |
| **B: Dedicated** | $354 | $6,000* | $6,354 | $530 |
| **B: Premium** | $714 | $6,000* | $6,714 | $560 |
| **Doing Nothing** | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |

\*Estimated based on discovery; actual determined by measurement

### The Real Cost of Doing Nothing

```
625 min/day on manual work × 250 work days = 155,000 min/year
155,000 min ÷ 60 = 2,583 hours/year

At $24/hour average: 2,583 × $24 = $61,992 in lost productivity
Per person per year of freed capacity: $6,000-15,000
```

**Your team could redirect $24,000-30,000/year of productive capacity to high-value work** like:
- Program development and improvement
- Strategic initiatives
- Client relationship building
- Staff development
- Revenue-generating activities
