---

## Executive Summary

We've completed a comprehensive discovery process with your team and identified **34.5 hours per day** (172.5 hours/week) in manual, repetitive work that can be eliminated through strategic automation. This proposal outlines:

1. **YIELD Framework™** - A performance-based automation billing model where you only pay for actual time saved
2. **Infrastructure Options** - Two clear paths to implement n8n automation
3. **Financial Impact** - Detailed ROI showing 1,084%+ return on investment (conservative 50% automation scenario)
4. **8-Week Accelerated Roadmap** - Phase-by-phase implementation plan

**Bottom line**: Invest $120-304/year in infrastructure + success-based fees on actual time saved = $107,640+ annual value freed (conservative) at zero upfront risk.

## The Problem: Current State Analysis

### Time Allocation Across Your Team

Our questionnaire revealed **625 minutes/day (10.4 hours/day)** spent on repetitive, manual work:

| Team Member | Role | Daily Hours | Key Pain Point |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cyle Feingold** | CEO | 6.0 hrs | 4 hrs/day data entry 🔴 |
| **Katie Tun Zan** | Program Mgmt | 13.0 hrs | Multi-system data sync |
| **Kristen** | Special Ed Director | 6.5 hrs | Copying data 5/5 frustration |
| **Jennifer Preston** | Business Manager | 4.75 hrs | Email triage & scheduling |
| **Nikki Milton** | HR | 4.25 hrs | Staff coordination |

**Combined**: 34.5 hours/day on manual processes = **8,625 hours/year** (at 50% automation potential)

### Annual Cost to Your Organization

At average staff salary of $50,000/year ($24/hour):

```
625 min/day × 250 work days = 155,000 minutes/year
155,000 min ÷ 60 = 2,583 hours/year
2,583 hours × $24/hour = $62,000/year in lost productivity
```

**This is money you're already paying for - being spent on tasks that shouldn't require human time.**

### Biggest Frustration Points

1. **Cyle's 4-hour/day data entry** (240 min) → Highest single opportunity
2. **Kristen's data copying** (frustration 5/5) → Moving between Teachworks + Sheets
3. **Katie's multi-system tracking** (13 hours/day) → Program, financial, compliance sheets
4. **Jennifer's email management** (120 min) → CEO routing and research
5. **Nikki's staff chasing** (30 min) → Getting timely responses

## The Solution: YIELD Framework™

### What is YIELD?

**YIELD Framework™** (Your Efficiency In Linearly-Delivered Expertise) is a performance-based automation model where:

- ✅ **You pay only for actual time saved** (measured monthly)
- ✅ **No risk** - If automation doesn't save time, you don't pay
- ✅ **Transparent** - See exact hours saved per workflow
- ✅ **Scalable** - Add more automations as you grow
- ✅ **Measurable** - Monthly dashboard shows ROI

### How It Works

1. **Baseline Measurement** (Week 1-2)
   - We precisely measure how long each process currently takes
   - Document exact steps, systems used, frequency
   - Establish "before" state with hard numbers

2. **Automation Design & Deployment** (Week 3-6)
   - Build n8n workflows for priority automations
   - Test thoroughly before going live
   - Train your team on new processes

3. **Live Measurement & Billing** (Week 7+)
   - Run automation alongside manual process for 2 weeks
   - Measure actual time saved (not theoretical)
   - Bill monthly based on real results
   - Monthly dashboard showing time saved, cost, ROI

### Billing Tiers

We bill per **hour of time actually saved** at tiered rates based on process complexity:

| Tier | Hourly Rate | Typical Processes |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** | €3/hour | Simple routing, form-to-sheet, email rules |
| **Tier 2** | €5/hour | Multi-system sync, data validation, reporting |
| **Tier 3** | €8/hour | Complex workflows, API integration, conditional logic |
| **Tier 4** | €10/hour | Custom development, special cases |

**Example**: If Kristen's weekly reporting saves 4 hours/week @ Tier 2 = €20/week = €80/month = €960/year

**Key feature**: You can disable any automation anytime. If we're not saving time, we don't charge.

---

## Infrastructure Options

You have two clear paths forward. Both use the same automation platform (n8n) but differ in ownership and management.

### Option A: Shared Infrastructure (RECOMMENDED) ✅

**You pay us a fixed monthly fee. We handle all infrastructure.**

```
Monthly Cost to Results Learning: $10/month ($120/year)
```

**What's included**:
- n8n automation platform (fully managed)
- Server hosting & monitoring (24/7)
- Automatic backups & disaster recovery
- SSL/HTTPS security
- Software updates & patches
- Unlimited workflows (n8n can handle 100+)

**How it works**:
- We maintain a server at Hetzner ($4.50/month)
- You're one of up to 10 clients on that server
- Each client gets isolated n8n instance
- We bill you monthly, you pay us

**Your advantage**:
- ✅ Simplest setup (24-48 hours)
- ✅ No infrastructure management
- ✅ Lowest infrastructure cost ($120/year)
- ✅ Focus on YIELD savings, not servers
- ✅ Can migrate to Option B anytime

**Our advantage**:
- We own infrastructure, can manage 10+ clients at this price
- Scales efficiently as we grow

**Invoice looks like**:
```
YIELD Services (measured monthly):           $300-500
Infrastructure & Hosting:                     $10
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly:                                $310-510
```

---

### Option B: Dedicated Server (Premium Control)

**You own your server. We manage setup and optional support.**

```
Monthly Infrastructure Cost to Results Learning: $4.50/month (Hetzner direct)
```

**What you own**:
- Dedicated Hetzner server (your account, your server)
- You're responsible for paying Hetzner directly
- You maintain complete control

**Our role** (choose one):

#### B1: Setup Only ($50 one-time)
- We set up n8n and PostgreSQL on your server
- We train your team
- You manage the server yourself (only call us for emergency support)

**Your cost**: $50 setup + $4.50/month (Hetzner) = ~$104/year
**Best for**: Tech-savvy teams, maximum autonomy

#### B2: Managed Support ($100 one-time + $10/month)
- Everything in B1, plus:
- Monthly monitoring & health checks
- Monthly updates & security patches
- Email support (48-hour response)

**Your cost**: $100 setup + $4.50/month (Hetzner) + $10/month = ~$304/year
**Best for**: Peace of mind, ongoing support

\*Based on €3-10/hour × annual hours saved (52 weeks of 24/7 automation)
†Value = hours freed × $24/hour average staff salary
**Key insight**: The 34.5 hours/day identified = $207,360/year potential value if fully automated (100% of hours)

### The Real Cost of Doing Nothing

If you don't automate, your team continues spending 34.5 hours/day on manual work:

```
Conservative Scenario (50% of identified work automated):
- Hours currently spent manually: 17.25 hours/day
- At $24/hour: $414/day in salary on manual work
- Per year (250 work days): $103,500 in salary on repetitive tasks
- What you're NOT investing: $9,090/year in automation
- Net loss from inaction: $94,410/year

Moderate Scenario (60% automated):
- Hours currently spent manually: 20.7 hours/day
- At $24/hour: $496.80/day in salary on manual work
- Per year (250 work days): $124,200 in salary on repetitive tasks
- What you're NOT investing: $10,884/year in automation
- Net loss from inaction: $113,316/year
```

**By NOT automating, you're choosing to keep paying $24,000-124,000/year in salary for work that software could do.**

**By automating, your team can redirect that capacity to high-value work** like:
- Program development and improvement
- Strategic initiatives
- Client relationship building
- Staff development
- Revenue-generating activities

## Closing

This isn't about technology - it's about reclaiming **24+ hours per week** that your team is currently spending on work that machines should do.

**YIELD Framework™ means**:
- You pay only for actual time saved (measured monthly)
- Zero upfront technology investment (just $10-30/month)
- Your team gets better, faster tools
- Cyle gets back 4 hours/day for strategy
- Kristen stops manually copying data
- Katie's program management becomes easier
- Jennifer's inbox gets cleared automatically
- Nikki's team coordination becomes seamless

**The choice is simple**:

**Option A**: Let us manage infrastructure for $10/month (simplest path)
**Option B**: You manage infrastructure yourself at $4.50/month + optional support (B1: $50 setup / B2: $100 setup + $10/month)

**Either way**: Your team gets back 15+ hours/week, measured monthly, paid only for actual results.
